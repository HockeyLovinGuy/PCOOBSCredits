# PCO OBS Credits
This leverages the Planning Center API (https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/overview/) to pull participants, songs, and different service elements from PCO Services and creates a text file to be used for end credits in OBS.

This is my first solo project, and was designed with the help of Google Gemini and ChatGPT.  There are some minor adjustments you'll need to be able to use this.

In PCOGPT2.py
    Update "APP_ID" on Line 7
    Update "APP_SECRET" on Line 8
    Update "service_type_id" on Lines 28, 46, 47

In PythonToTxt.py update the following for footer details:
    Update Line 31 with Church URL
    Update Line 33 with Facebook URL
    Update Line 34 with Instagram URL
    Update Line 35 with YouTube URL

I would love to see this advance beyond my skills, and if you want an enchancement, but aren't really strong with code let me know and we can work on it.
